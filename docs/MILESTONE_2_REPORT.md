## 2. Feature Implementation Detail

### 🐾 2.1 Multi-Pet Registry
Users can now manage a diverse collection of pets within a single account. The system ensures strict data isolation, allowing only the owner to access or modify their pets' information.
- **Attributes Tracked**: Name, Breed, Age (years), Weight (kg), Gender, and Pet Type (Dog, Cat, etc.).
- **Capabilities**: Add, Edit, and View detailed pet profiles.

### 💉 2.2 Medical & Vaccination Tracking
A centralized hub for all health-related activities.
- **Medical History**: Stores chronological records of veterinary visits, including clinical diagnoses, treatments provided, and scheduled follow-up dates.
- **Vaccination Management**: 
    - Tracks specific vaccines and dose numbers.
    - **Dynamic Status Logic**: Automatically calculates status as **Upcoming**, **Completed**, or **Overdue** based on current date vs. next due date.
    - **Proof of Vaccination**: Supports file uploads (PDF/Images) for official vaccination certificates.

### ⏰ 2.3 Automated Reminder System
To improve pet health compliance, we implemented a background scheduling engine.
- **Technology**: Spring `@Scheduled` tasks running daily at 9:00 AM.
- **Logic**: 
    - **2-Day Lead**: Notifies owners 48 hours before a vaccination is due.
    - **Due Date**: Sends a final alert on the actual due date.
- **Reliability**: Includes duplicate prevention to ensure owners aren't overwhelmed by multiple emails for the same record.

### 📄 2.4 Health Reports (PDF)
On-demand professional health documentation for sharing with veterinarians or for personal record-keeping.
- **Generation**: Powered by the `ReportService` using the iText library.
- **Report Content**:
    - **Pet Profile**: Summary of identity and physical traits.
    - **Medical Summary**: Table of past visits and treatments.
    - **Immunization Table**: List of vaccinations with status-based color coding (e.g., Red for Overdue).
